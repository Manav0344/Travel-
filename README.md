# Travel-
Create a responsive travel website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website should showcase various travel destinations, display travel packages, provide information about the company, and include interactive elements like an image slider or a dynamic destination filter.
This is a static frontend project with a focus on design, layout, and basic interactivity â€” no backend or database integration is required.
